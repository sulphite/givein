          'A huge fire erupted in Moscow-annexed Crimea after a suspected drone attack hit an oil depot on Saturday, asand shelling deprived Russian border villages of power. The attacks came one day after Kyiv said preparations for a long-awaited counteroffensive were nearly complete, having vowed to expel Russian forces from territory they seized in the east and south following their 2022 invasion. On Friday, a Russian strike on a bloc of flats in the central Ukrainian city of Uman killed 23 people, including a baby boy. On Saturday, officials in Moscow-controlled Crimea, towns under Russian occupation in southern Ukraine and a governor of a border region reported attacks. Fears of Ukrainian reprisals more than a year into Moscow\'s offensive have grown in Russia, where a range of cities have cancelled traditional May 9 celebrations to mark Soviet victory over the Nazis at the end of World War II in 1945. In Sevastopol, home to Russia\'s Black Sea Fleet, clouds of smoke rose high into the sky as a fuel reserved burned. The port city has been hit by a series of drone attacks since Moscow\'s invasion of Ukraine began more than a year ago. Russian-installed authorities said the fire was caused by a suspected drone but sought to downplay the incident, amid rising security fears on the peninsula. The Kremlin said nothing about the attack. It came less than 24 hours after Russia struck a typical Soviet-era housing bloc in the historic city of Uman, killing more than two dozen of its residents. Kyiv on Saturday identified five children killed in the attack as an 18-month-old boy, three girls aged eight, 11 and 14, and a 16-year-old boy. "One woman is considered missing. The search continues," Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said. Ukraine did not claim the Crimea attack, but military intelligence implied it was revenge for Uman. Andriy Yusov, from the defence ministry\'s intelligence unit, said it was "God\'s punishment, in particularly for the civilians killed in Uman." He warned people in Crimea to "avoid being near military facilities and facilities providing the aggressor\'s army in the near future." On the Russian-annexed peninsula, the governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, urged Crimeans to "remain calm" and said "nobody was hurt." He estimated the fire was "around 1,000 square metres" (10,764 square feet). Razvozhayev insisted that the peninsula\'s reserves were not impacted and that authorities had enough fuel for all civilian needs. Earlier this week, Moscow said it had repelled a drone strike on Crimea -- annexed by Russia in 2014 and used as a launchpad for its invasion. In southern Ukraine, Russian occupation authorities said a key city they control -- Novaya Kakhovka -- had come under "intense shelling" and had been cut off from power. The city fell to Russian forces on the first day of their invasion on February 24, 2022. It lies in the part of the Kherson region that Moscow still controls, having withdrawn from the eponymous regional capital last November. Russian forces urged people in the city "to keep calm" and said that work to restore power will start "after the shelling ends." The shelling of Novaya Kakhovka came a day after Russian shelling killed a 57-year-old woman in a southern Ukrainian village, with Ukraine\'s President Volodymyr Zelensky vowing a response. Inside Russia, security fears have grown amid talk of a Ukrainian counteroffensive. The governor of the border Belgorod region -- that has also been hit by a series of attacks throughout the war -- said Saturday that five frontier villages were without power after Ukrainian shelling. "The power lines are damaged," Gladkov said, adding that there were no victims. He said an uninhabited house had been hit and promised to restore power quickly. Elsewhere, Russia accused Poland -- with whom it has historically poor relations -- of a "blatant violation" of international norms after Warsaw impounded a school run by the Russian embassy in the Polish capital. Moscow called the move an "illegal act" and promised "harsh" consequences against Warsaw. Independent journalism costs money. Support Times of Malta for the',

          "Peacock’s new series, produced and narrated by Amy Poehler, has much more on its mind than just decluttering your home",
        content:
          "Decluttering has become an industry in itself in recent years, with Hoarders prompting TV viewers to recoil in shock at the sight of dwellings stacked to the brim with stuff and Marie Kondo teaching readers The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up . Let there never be a doubt that a buck can be made off human slovenliness. But even with this glut there’s a place for The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning , the new Peacock series based on Margareta Magnusson’s book of the same name. With a big heart, self-knowing wit, and an efficiency you might expect from the title, the show comes not to shame people but to celebrate their resilience, one lifestyle makeover at a time. Executive produced and narrated by Amy Poehler , Death Cleaning is also quite cheeky, especially for a show in which mortality is never far from the conversation. As Poehler puts it in her narration, the death cleaners, Johan, Katarina and Ella, excel at “cleaning out your crap so others don’t have to when you’re dead.” One of the contestants, Shana, actually has terminal lung cancer, and the cleaners help her not merely to fix up her residence but also to talk to her friends and family about what she needs, including a strong dose of openness and honesty. Or, as Katarina, the earthy, yoga-teaching psychologist of the trio, puts it: “We’re all born, and we’re all going to die. So let’s talk about it.” Each cleaner has a different specialty. Johan, youthful and quietly snarky, is the designer, and Ella, an older woman with big, square, très chic eyeglasses, is the organizer. But their approach is holistic and team-oriented. The series has fun juxtaposing their Swedishness, their stoic good cheer and purpose-driven approach, with their chronically disorganized American clientele. As Poehler says, they work “with the efficiency that can only come from a country that gives its health care away for free.” But they’re also good on television, pithy but somehow genuine, especially compared to the canned personalities that clutter so much of the reality TV landscape. Editor’s picks The 50 Worst Decisions in Music History The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time The 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time Gentle Art manages to be frank and funny with its clutterers without stooping into condescension. And the show has some great characters with which to work. The first episode introduces us to Suzy, a 75-year-old stoner from Kansas City who clings to wardrobe, photos, and other remnants of her days as a resort comedienne and singer. She likes to collect. “I have a lot of penises,” she explains to Johan, showing off her collection of ceramics and other phallic artifacts. “You’re a gay man,” Johan tells her. Time to get rid of some penises, and plenty of other stuff. The team takes Suzy to a creative reuse shop, which gives the show a chance to remind us that about one percent of trash in Sweden ends up in a landfill. Then they donate much of her fabulous spangly wardrobe to a drag show, which she happily attends. Suzy is a little kooky, but she is also admirably down for whatever. Trending ‘Citadel’ Is a $300 Million Disaster for Amazon Ron DeSantis F-cked With the Wrong Fandom Elon Musk and Bill Maher Warn Against the 'Woke Mind Virus,' a.k.a. Historical Fact Post Malone Addresses Concerns About His Weight Loss: He Isn't Doing Drugs, He's Just a Dad The series has more on its mind than most reality fare, and it grapples with big questions in an approachable way. Why do we cling to certain things, including outdated feelings and ideas? Why are we afraid of death? Why do we so often look backward instead of forward? How to clear the spiritual decks and lighten the load? Lindsey and her family, for instance, live in a house crammed with ugly furniture, creepy dolls, and hideous paintings passed down from previous generations. Why? Because she is expected to. She doesn’t want to disappoint anyone, and she’s scared of what it might mean to live her own life. Gentle Art leans pretty hard into the idea that the cleaners are decluttering people’s souls along with their homes. However, to be fair, that’s kind of what they’re doing. Without getting too cute, or too dour, the series actually asks us to consider philosophical matters of life and death, as manifested by the ways and places in which we choose to live. This is no mean feat. The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning is certainly fun, and perhaps even occasionally cloying. But it also achieves an unexpected emotional resonance. It might even make you want to finally straighten out that long-neglected upstairs closet.",

          "The British union leader praised unions across Northern Ireland that had taken industrial action in recent months at a rally gathered at Belfast City Hall.",
        content:
          "UK TRADE UNIONIST Mick Lynch has told a crowd of workers and activists in Belfast that the “ultra right” is causing division during the cost-of-living crisis, and it should be resisted. He also praised unions across Northern Ireland that had taken industrial action in recent months, and called for the trade union movement to begin in every town and county, saying that people were “ready for change”. The general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said he has received a “tremendous” welcome as he met and marched with activists and trade unions through Belfast. Lynch rose to prominence last summer following a series of media interviews about a rail workers’ strike held in the UK in a long-running dispute over pay and conditions. The trade union leader, whose father left Cork city in 1941 to travel to Britain to work, and whose mother is from Co Armagh, addressed a rally gathered at Belfast City Hall today. Addressing trade union groups including Unison, Nipsa, Unite and the Northern Ireland Teachers Council, who have all taken industrial action in recent months, Lynch said that the values of the trade union movement “are back on the agenda”. He said that nurses in Britain “are on the move” towards industrial action following on from strikes by nurses in Northern Ireland, which was met with applause. “The trade unionists on this island are the salt of the earth, and they’ve kept the movement going through thick and thin, through all the struggles that you’ve had, the struggles for peace and justice and democracy. “It’s been the trade unions that have kept our spirits alive, that have kept this movement going, bringing all of our people together, no matter what their heritage, no matter what their background, and we have to keep doing it. “Because we know what’s being said: the ultra right are going to exploit division. “They’re seeking to do it in the south, they’re seeking to do it up here. “They’re seeking to do it in England.” He said that “open Nazis are trying to divide our people one from another”, by “trying to blame some of the poorest people in the world for our problems over here”. “We cannot allow that to happen,” he said. He warned against authorities using global crises for denying workers better pay and conditions. “They can dress it up wherever they want, they can blame it on the pandemic. “They can blame it on the economy. “Now they’re blaming it on a war in eastern Europe. “What is to blame is capitalism, exploitation, the deliberate creation of poverty so that they can enrich themselves and we’ve got to stand up to that.” As trade union members gathered in Writers’ Square ahead of the march through Belfast, Lynch was asked to pose for pictures and selfies with workers bearing various trade union banners. He was given a small bust of the founder of the 1916 leader James Connolly, a book about the history of trade unions in Ireland and pinned a University and College Union badge given to him to his jacket. As he began to address, he praised the prominence of women in Northern Ireland in the trade union movement, after the crowd was addressed by leaders including Unison’s Patricia McKeowan and Unite’s Susan Fitzgerald. ICTU assistant general secretary Gerry Murphy said Lynch was addressing the May Day march as “every trade unionist across these islands, and many outside our movement, have been inspired and encouraged by the wisdom and clarity offered” by Lynch.",

          "The southernmost state of Kerala in peninsular India is at least 2,300 km far from Balochistan province in Pakistan. What links these two regions which are different in every aspect- be it geographical, climatic or political? The answer is the exploitative nature of human beings, who are at war with the environment, more out of greed than necessity, without realising what is in the offing – despite nature sending several visible signs. Both India and Pakistan are victims of climate change. Balochistan province in Pakistan and Kerala in India are faced by environment issues because the forests in both the regions are cut by the population for encroachment and fuel. Two sites, which have been recognised by UNESCO as heritage sites, are slowly facing the wrath of nature, as human exploitation is at its peak. The famous Western Ghats run along the western coast of peninsular India for 1,600 km and touch six states including Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, covering the whole length of Kerala and ending at Marunthvazh Malai in Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu. Of these six states, the state of Kerala (which has the highest population density among Indian states) alone accounts for 40% of the ghats, with maximum human agglomeration on the highly ecologically fragile mountain range. Meanwhile, hundreds of kilometres away in Balochistan, another region recognised by UNESCO is facing a similar fate. Almost 100 km away from Balochistan’s capital city of Quetta is Asia’s biggest juniper forest in Ziarat. Kabir Khan, 50, keeps his guest room warm with the traditional stove fuelled by the trunks and branches of juniper trees. Ironically, the ceiling of the same room where he lights the tree for fire is made up of the planks of the very same tree. In effect, like for thousands of others, the juniper tree is everything for Kabir Khan too. On 6 August 2020, a small housing colony – if at all they can be called houses – where the workers of a private tea plantation situated at Pettimudi on the slopes of of the Rajamalai hills in Idukki district, the majority of which is situated on the ghats, woke up to see gushing water and mud flowing down from the hilltops. The heavy landslide that engulfed the area in a matter of a few seconds, took 70 lives out of 81 people whose world was those one-room ‘houses’ in a few lanes. The Pettimudy disaster was not the first one. The state of Kerala had witnessed the biggest flood in over a century just two years ago in 2018 – taking the lives of 483 people, of which 152 died in the landslides. The floods caused heavy devastation in the state, and the losses were estimated at Rs 31,000 crore (Rs 310 billion). On the other hand, Ziarat district is at an altitude of 16,000 feet above ocean level, making it one of the coolest regions and locally people call it Tanda—the cold Ziarat. Winter months are unbearable here. The village Chautheer is far away from the main city, covered in the woods shielded from the forest guards and other arms of the government. This secluded village – distant not only from enforcement agencies, but also the welfare schemes that are supposed to reach the local masses – forces Kabir Khan to fell the juniper trees during the winter like other villagers. “We cut these beautiful trees out of necessity. The harsh weather and the lack of an alternate fuel are forcing us to cut them down. These trees are also cut down and transported to other districts in large numbers,” he said. The year before – 2017 – saw the Ockhi cyclone that devastated both lives and properties as well as the popular belief that the state was relatively safe from cyclones. In another extreme, the state saw the harshest draught in 120 years despite the fact that as much as 29.65% of the total area of the state being green forests, of which 9195.735 square km are reserve forests, 291.575 square km are proposed reserves and 1905.476 square km are vested forests and ecologically fragile lands. Environmentalists and those who oppose the lopsided developmental vision have been asserting that these are repeated alarm bells to understand what awaits us in the future ahead. Still, the number of granite quarries is steadily going up. There are already 610 legal quarries functioning in the state, with at least three to four times of this number in the illegal category. A census undertaken in 2017 shows that the population of Ziarat is 160,000 and the total area under the forest cover is 101, 000 hectares. The Junipers are slow-growing trees, and some of them are recorded to have aged above 1,000 years. As per the experts, Juniper replantation is impossible. The Juniper trees fall victim to not only the local population, who have no other alternative to fight the winters, but these trees are forced to make space for apple plantations, which is a more lucrative business. Though the local law is in force that punishes those who are felling the Junipers, the existing penalty is too paltry to have any deterrent effect over the law breakers. Those caught red-handed need to pay a meagre penalty of 5,000 PKR (US$ 18), which is another reason that paves the way for the possible death of the Ziarat Juniper forest. The government is still lagging far behind in taking concrete steps to address the serious issues that are being cited in the inter-governmental panel report on climate change, says Kerala’s opposition leader V D Satheesan, who has taken up several environmental issues in the past. “The state has become a place which is susceptible to drastic climatic changes since 2015. It is yet to learn and take the necessary steps despite thousands of landslides have been reported from Western Ghats. Even after the 2018 floods, the government sanctioned more than 200 quarries in the state. This lopsided vision about development will have to be redrawn at the earliest before it is too late,” he said. In a state like Kerala of which 54.7% of the area is under forest cover, as much as 12415.896 acres of forest land in the state are under encroachment and are under court litigation in various courts across the state, as per the figures of the Forest and Wildlife Department. As much as 43727.89 acres of forest have been destroyed in wildfire in the last one decade. These are just the official figures, and the actual figures are many times this number. Earlier, the winters used to be so harsh that the people of Ziarat would migrate to neighbouring Harnai and Sibbi, but global climate change started impacting these regions as well. The changes in climatic conditions forced the people to stop their seasonal migration and they started to cut the Juniper trees for survival. Felling these precious trees begins from November when the winter sets in, and sometimes goes up to March or April, which would mean that a substantial number of trees are lit in the fireplace in these six months. Nevertheless, the Indian government is presenting a rosy picture of forest conservation. As per the statistics presented before the legislative assembly, the extent of area under the forests in the state have increased in the last one decade. Between 2011 and 2019, the total area under forest has increased by 210.5826 square km. While it was 11309.4754 square km of forest in 2011, it increased to 11520.058 square km by 2019. The increase in the area under the forest cover is mainly being achieved by including mangroves, porambokes (no man’s land) and areas that have been earmarked but are yet to be declared as reserve forests etc, under the category of forests. “There is hardly any awareness regarding the need to conserve the Western Ghats. The communities are more influenced or even threatened by the local politicians who have vested interests in implementing the ‘developmental projects’. These point out the urgent need for the governments of six states along the Western Ghats- Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat- to come together and chart a comprehensive future plan to protect the 1600-km long region,” says Viju B, senior environment journalist and author of the book . The lack of a strong law is always a strong deterrent against protecting any rare species, whether trees or animals. The only act that exists here is the British colonial era act for forest regulation, which is too weak to punish the culprits involved in cutting the Ziarat Juniper trees. Though the government passed the Balochistan Forest Act, 2022, it is yet to be enforced. It is evident from the fact that the government has deployed only 200 employees for the protection of the vast forest region. “The new Forest Act by the Balochistan assembly is still under making, and the rules are yet to be framed”, says Syed Ghulam Muhammad, the chief conservator of Ziarat Juniper forest. “The government research shows that many areas of the forest are becoming regenerating areas, if these new plants are protected then they can naturally grow,” he adds, as a silver-lining statement. Earlier, the winters used to be so harsh that the people of Ziarat would migrate to neighbouring Harnai and Sibbi, but global climate change started impacting these regions as well. The changes in climatic conditions forced the people to stop their seasonal migration and they started to cut the Juniper trees for survival, Kabir Khan. Felling these precious trees begins from November when the winter sets in, sometime goes up to March or April, which would mean that a substantial number of trees are lit in the fireplace in these six months. The Ziarat Juniper forest has been declared as a “bioreserve” region by UNESCO and they are also living “fossils.” Sanaullah Tareen, 40, a local resident and activist for the forests and social rights, blames the government for not ensuring adequate gas supply as fuel during these winter months, so that the public refrain from depending on these fossil fuels. “People are forced to cut down natural wealth. If they are provided with an alternate fuel for surviving these winter months, none will harm these trees. Along with this, the law also should be tightened. Unless we act quickly without wasting any further time, the Juniper will be extinct from here forever,” he says. Along with human intervention, another factor is also contributing to the extinction of the Juniper trees. The parasite attacks on these trees are also taking a heavy toll on them, and healthy Junipers have now become a rare phenomenon. These situations create a grim future for Juniper trees. These trees would grow only in cold weather. “When Pakistan is facing a drastic climate change, these trees are facing a natural extinction too,” says Dr Shazia Saeed, professor at the University of Balochistan, who has done extensive research on the Ziarat Juniper forest. “The government should also fence the regenerating forest trees so that this precious vegetation is protected,” she says. Governments everywhere claim that they are doing the best. But drawing the line of demarcation between human encroachments out of necessity and greed is what is immediately expected out of the government, along with ensuring pro-environment welfare schemes so that the people and nature coexist peacefully. And this must be done before environmental degradation leads to larger dangers – which nature has hinted at multiple times.",

          "More than 500 people have been killed since battles erupted on April 15",
        content:
          'Warplanes on bombing raids drew heavy anti-aircraft fire over Khartoum on Saturday as fierce fighting between Sudan\'s army and paramilitaries entered a third week, violating a renewed truce. More than 500 people have been killed since battles erupted on April 15 between the forces of army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his number two Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who commands the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). They have agreed to multiple truces but none has effectively taken hold as the number of dead civilians continues to rise and chaos and lawlessness grip Khartoum, a city of five million people where many have been cloistered in their homes lacking food, water, and electricity. Tens of thousands of people have been uprooted within Sudan or embarked on arduous trips to neighbouring Chad, Egypt, South Sudan and Ethiopia to flee the battles. "There is no right to go on fighting for power when the country is falling apart," UN chief Antonio Guterres told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television. The latest three-day ceasefire -- due to expire at midnight (2200 GMT) Sunday -- was agreed Thursday after mediation led by the United States, Saudi Arabia, the African Union and the United Nations. "We woke up once again to the sound of fighter jets and anti-aircraft weapons blasting all over our neighbourhood," a witness in south Khartoum told AFP. Another witness said fighting had continued since the early morning, especially around the state broadcaster\'s headquarters in the capital\'s twin city of Omdurman. Other witnesses reported exchanges of machine gun fire across the Blue Nile in Khartoum North, while the sound of gunfire rang out in Burri in the east of the city. Smoke drifted over the area around Khartoum airport. UN head of mission Volker Perthes said Friday that tensions between the rival generals had been "clear" before the fighting broke out. But "there was no... early warning that battles will begin on the morning of" April 15, Perthes told Al Jazeera television, adding that efforts had been made to de-escalate the tensions. As battles raged, the rival generals -- who seized power in a 2021 coup -- took aim at each other in the media, with Burhan branding the RSF a militia that aims "to destroy Sudan" and Daglo calling the army chief "a traitor". Guterres threw his support behind African-led mediation efforts. "My appeal is for everything to be done to support an African-led initiative for peace in Sudan," he told Al Arabiya. The violence has killed at least 528 people and wounded 4,599, the health ministry said Saturday, but those figures are likely to be incomplete. About 75,000 have been displaced by the fighting in Khartoum and the states of Blue Nile, North Kordofan, as well as the western region of Darfur, the UN said. The fighting has also triggered a mass exodus of foreigners and international staff. On Saturday, a ferry with around 1,900 evacuees arrived at a Saudi naval base in Jeddah, after crossing the Red Sea from Port Sudan, in the latest evacuation to the kingdom by sea. An Emirati evacuation plane arrived from Sudan carrying citizens and nationals from 16 countries, the United Arab Emirates said. They are among almost 4,880 people who have been brought to safety in the kingdom, the Saudi foreign ministry said. Britain said it would end its evacuation flights on Saturday, after airlifting more than 1,500 people this week. The World Food Programme has said the violence could plunge millions more into hunger in a country where 15 million people -- one-third of the population -- already need aid to stave off famine. About 70 percent of hospitals in areas near the fighting have been put out of service and many have been shelled, the doctors\' union said. In West Darfur state, at least 96 people were reported to have been killed in the city of El Geneina this week, the UN said. "What\'s happening in Darfur is terrible, the society is falling apart, we see tribes that now try to arm themselves," Guterres said. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said there were reports of widespread looting, destruction, and burning of property, including at camps for displaced people. MSF deputy operations manager for Sudan, Sylvain Perron, said the fighting had forced the agency to stop almost all its activities in West Darfur. "We are incredibly worried about the impact this violence is having on people who have already lived through waves of violence in the previous years." Darfur is still reeling from a war that erupted in 2003 when then hardline president Omar al-Bashir unleashed the Janjaweed militia, mainly recruited from Arab pastoralist tribes, against ethnic minority rebels. The scorched-earth campaign left at least 300,000 people dead and close to 2.5 million displaced, according to UN figures, and saw Bashir charged with war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide by the International Criminal Court. The Janjaweed later evolved into the RSF, which was formally created in 2013. The 2021 coup that brought Burhan and Daglo to power derailed the transition to elective civilian rule launched after Bashir was ousted following mass protests in 2019. The two generals later fell out, most recently over the planned integration of the RSF into the regular army. bur/kir Independent journalism costs money. Support Times of Malta for the',

          "The United Nations special representative in Sudan says he has recently sensed a change in the attitudes of the country's warring sides regarding peace talks.",
        content:
          'Air strikes and artillery have rocked Khartoum as Sudan entered a third week of fighting between rival military forces despite a ceasefire, prompting more civilians to flee and renewed warnings of wider instability if the war is not stopped. As dark smoke rose over Khartoum, a United Nations envoy offered a possible flicker of hope, saying the warring sides who have so far shown no sign of compromise were now more open to negotiations - although no date had been set. Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands wounded since April 15 when a long-simmering power struggle between Sudanese the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) erupted into conflict. Despite shelling early in the morning, residents of the capital Khartoum and its neighbouring cities said the fighting had been less intense on Saturday than in recent days. The fighting has pitched Sudan towards a civil war that has derailed an internationally-backed transition toward democratic elections and could destabilise a volatile region. The sides have continued to battle it out during a series of ceasefires mediated by foreign powers, notably the United States. The latest 72-hour truce expires at midnight on Sunday. On Saturday, the RSF accused the army of violating the ceasefire in areas under its control. There was no immediate comment from the army, which has previously blamed the RSF for violations and which said on Saturday its forces were continuing to work to end "the rebellion". The prospects of negotiations between the leaders of the two sides have so far seemed bleak. On Friday, army leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said he would never sit down with the RSF\'s "rebel" leader, referring to General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is more commonly known as Hemedti. The RSF chief in turn said he would talk only after the army ceased hostilities. Nonetheless, the UN special representative in Sudan Volker Perthes told Reuters he had recently sensed a change in the sides\' attitudes and they were more open to negotiations. "The word \'negotiations\' or \'talks\' was not there in their discourse in the first week or so," Perthes said. Perthes said the sides had nominated representatives for talks which had been suggested for Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, or Juba in South Sudan although he said there was a practical question over whether they could get there to "actually sit together". The immediate task, Perthes said, was to develop a monitoring mechanism for ceasefires. Perthes noted that he had told the UN Security Council both sides thought they could win the conflict but he also said attitudes were changing. While the sides had made statements that the other side had to "surrender or die," Perthes said, they were also saying, "okay we accept... some form of talks". "They have both accepted that this war cannot continue." At least 528 people have been killed and 4599 wounded, the Sudanese health ministry told al-Jazeera, slightly more than a tally by the UN which believes the real toll is much higher. The UN said more than 75,000 people had been internally displaced by the fighting. Former Sudanese prime minister Abdalla Hamdok, speaking at a conference in Nairobi, said the war must stop, warning of its ramifications not just in Sudan but in the region. "This is a huge country, very diverse... I think it will be a nightmare for the world," he said. "This is not a war between an army and small rebellion. It is almost like two armies - well trained and well armed." Tens of thousands of people have fled to neighbouring countries while foreign governments have organised a major repatriation of expatriates. Saudi state broadcaster Alekhbaiya said that a passenger ship with 1982 people on board from 17 countries will arrive at Jeddah port on Saturday and almost 5000 had already arrived.',

          "Rajnath Singh and Sergei Shoigu held talks on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) defence ministers’ gathering in New Delhi. “They acknowledged the unique, long-lasting and time-tested relationship between India and Russia,” the statement said. They “expressed satisfaction over the continued trust and mutual respect between the two countries, particularly in defence and reiterated their commitment towards strengthening the partnership,” it said, without elaborating. India, the world’s largest arms importer, depends on Russia for nearly half its military supplies, and has bought fighter jets, tanks, nuclear submarines and an aircraft carrier over the decades. But the war in Ukraine has held up supplies of Russian spares critical for India to maintain its tank and fighter jet fleets and delayed the delivery of Russian air defence systems. India has refused to publicly blame Russia for the war in Ukraine and has increased its trade with Moscow to a record high, driven largely by the import of Russian oil. Several Western leaders have criticised India’s proximity to Russia as they try to isolate Moscow since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. New Delhi says it defending its interests in buying Russian oil and has pushed for a diplomatic solution to the conflict. Moscow, which faces an expected by Ukrainian forces in the coming weeks, the defence ministers of Iran, Syria and Turkey on Tuesday and Shoigu also held with China’s defence minister on April 18. Shoigu told the SCO meeting that the real aim of the West in Ukraine is to strategically defeat Russia, to pose a threat to China, and to maintain its own monopoly position, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported.",

Over three years later, Apple filed to drop the suit. The request was filed in state court in San Jose, California earlier in the week, according to Bloomberg , however the filing doesn't say why it was dropped at all. Apple didn't respond to a requests for comment on Friday over the filing. The lawsuit originally alleged that Williams had used his years of access to Apple's information to start Nuvia, in a field he worked on at Apple. At the time, the iPhone maker's filing said that \"by 2018, Williams had started his new venture on Apple's dime.\" Williams also allegedly took measures to avoid \"written communications that he thought Apple could find,\" such as by phoning potential recruits or used Nuvia colleagues to contact them on his behalf. In response, Williams filed a counterargument insisting the anti-competitive clauses were against the state legislature. The court allowed the suit to continue despite Williams' \"notice of demurrer.\" By January 2021, Nuvia was acquired by Qualcomm for $1.4 billion.
